## Problem Statement 
A fast-growing fashion and beauty startup needed to evaluate and improve the efficiency of its supply chain operations. Key areas of focus included inventory optimization, supplier performance, quality control, and logistics efficiency.

  
**Tools used:** PowerBI â€¢ Excel â€¢ GitHub

## Objective
As a Business Analyst for a newly launched fashion and beauty startup, my objective was to evaluate the company's supply chain operations using a data-driven approach to:

- Identify inefficiencies in transportation and supplier performance
- Minimize operational and delivery costs
- Improve product quality and inspection turnaround
- Optimize inventory management across SKUs

### Business Questions Answered

1. Which product categories and customer segments drive the most revenue?
2. How efficient and cost-effective are our logistics and transportation modes?
3. What is the current state of product quality and manufacturing efficiency?
4. Which suppliers or locations are performing best in terms of cost, quality, and speed?
5. Are there inefficiencies in our inventory management and product movement?

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaning & preparation of data was performed in python.
- Removed percentage symbols from 60_day_engagement_rate and converted to decimal.
- Handled missing values in country by researching influencer locations.
- Standardized numeric columns (followers, likes, etc.) and fixed data types.
- Created new calculated fields:
  1. Engagement Rate (%) = (avg_likes / followers) * 100
  2. Growth Rate (%) = ((new_post_avg_like - avg_likes) / avg_likes) * 100
- Labeled unknown countries as "Unknown" for optional filtering in dashboards.
- Saved the cleaned dataset as top_insta_influencers_updated.xlsx.
